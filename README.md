# Save Walter White Tribute

A parody single-page website built with React and a retro 2008 vibe â€” inspired by Walter Jr.'s fundraising website in *Breaking Bad*.  
This tribute project recreates the hilariously outdated look and feel of early internet charity sites, complete with fake donors, awkward fonts, and a tribute to the one who knocks.
